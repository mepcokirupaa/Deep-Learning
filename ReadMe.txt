Problem Statements
------------------------
        Leukemia, a subdivision of cancer, develops in human blood and bone marrow.
       The reason behind is the expeditious and sudden formation and accumulation of WBCs in the blood. 
        Identification and diagnosis of these types of abnormalities by humans is difficult and may lead to misidentification.Manual calculation in Cancer Research center will take more time. 
       Therefore an automatic system for the identification would be of great help.
